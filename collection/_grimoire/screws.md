Screws are used to fasten things against one another.

# Countersunk screws
The bottom of the head, as it connects to the body of the screw, can either be
flat and sit flat *on top of* the material, or be countersunk (sv: försänkt) and
sit flush *with* the surface of the material

An alternate use for a countersunk screw is to center something with a round
hole against something else. However this risks putting strain on the screw
head in a way that is probably not very good.

# Slot

The slot determines what screwdriver is used to drive the screw and how good a
grip the intended screwdriver gets.

* **Flat:** just a flat screwdriver. Poor grip. Pretty uncommon in this day and
  age.
* **Cross:** more fancily called a Phillips, it's a plus-sign. Probably the
  most common slot.
* **Pozidriv:** a cross with a smaller cross rotated 45 degrees inside. Looks a
  lot like a regular cross, but grip will be lacking if using one. Deceptive
  little bastards.
* **Hex:** a hexagon! Usually driven with an allen wrench, commonly found in
  IKEA furniture.
* **Torx:** a hexagram! Relatively common and gets amazing grip.
* **Tri-point:** looks like a Y. Used in equipment by manufacturers who resent
  the right to repair such as Nintendo.

# Thread

Thread (sv: gänga) is the tracks around the screw that guide the screw into
position. They are considered fine if their pitch is tight. Bolts are usually a
lot finer than screws, as screws need to self-tap what they're going into.

# *Screws* vs *bolts*

Bolts (sv: bult) are usually distinguished from screws in that they are made to
fit into a pre-tapped hole or a nut, whereas screws self-thread the hole,
albeit not necessarily self-drilling. The technical disinction is a bit
unclear, but that's for Wikipedia to care about.

# Nuts

A nut (sv: mutter) is what a bolt goes into!

---

# Washers

A washer (sv: bricka) helps distribute force, preventing damage against both
screw and material.

# Metric screw standards

Metric screw standards, especially bolts, are labelled 'M*N*' e.g. M2, M10
where the number represents the diameter of the screw in millimeters. Although
often omitted, a thread pitch can be specified in millimeters with a postfix of
'×*N*', e.g. 'M2.5×0.5'. A length is often specified in marketing using the
same format however, e.g. 'M3×10'. If this was a thread pitch denomination, it
would of course be a very silly one as M3 screws are usually not so long that
there'd be more than one or two total revolutions of the thread.

Commonly used sizes are:

* M2
* M3
* M4
* M6
* M8
* M10
* ...

Pok3r-case 60% keyboards use M2.5 screws. It's awful.

# Funky screws

* **Hexagonal heads:** Hex bolts usually have no slot and are instead turned
  with a wrench.

* **Train bolts:** train bolts have a rounded head that cannot be gripped by
  mortal hands and no slot, meaning they can only be tightened by turning the
  nut.

* **Set screws:** also known as grub screws (sv: stoppskruv), they are
  headless. They may have a slot in the body of the screw, usually a hexagonal
  one.
