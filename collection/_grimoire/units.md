Units are the references we use to measure real world phenomena. They are
either defined in relation to real world measurement, or in relation to other
units.

# Quantity

Units themselves do not carry quantities, nor do quantities carry units. That
said, both must be notated for concrete measurements. Twelve is a an abstract
quantity, and egg is an abstraction of a physical item. A dozen eggs, on the
other hand, is something you can buy at the grocery store.

Quantities are often rounded to an extent. Three decimal points or three digits
of precision is usually a good rule of thumb where precision is not required.
Excessive precision makes you look like a know-it-all, or a conspiracy
theorist.

Examples of notation for the frequency 20,327 Hz:

| Notation    | Written                  |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Plain       | 20,327 Hz                |
| Prefixed    | 20   kHz                 |
| Scientific  | 2.0327×10<sup>4</sup> Hz |
| Engineering | 20.033E3 Hz              |

## Prefixes

Quantities are often specified by common prefixes.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Common_metric_prefixes).

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor         | Power            |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------------|
| tera   | T      | 1000000000000  | 10<sup>12</sup>  |
| giga   | G      | 1000000000     | 10<sup>9</sup>   |
| mega   | M      | 1000000        | 10<sup>6</sup>   |
| kilo   | k      | 1000           | 10<sup>3</sup>   |
| hecto  | h      | 100            | 10<sup>2</sup>   |
| deca   | da     | 10             | 10<sup>1</sup>   |
| (none) | (none) | 1              | 10<sup>0</sup>   |
| deci   | d      | 0.1            | 10<sup>-1</sup>  |
| centi  | c      | 0.01           | 10<sup>-2</sup>  |
| milli  | m      | 0.001          | 10<sup>-3</sup>  |
| micro  | μ      | 0.000001       | 10<sup>-6</sup>  |
| nano   | n      | 0.000000001    | 10<sup>-9</sup>  |
| pico   | p      | 0.000000000001 | 10<sup>-12</sup> |

## Scientific notation

Scientific notation specifies quantity in the format of a × 10<sup>n</sup> for 1 ≤ a < 10 and any integer n.

The `*10^n` can be replaced by `En`, e.g. `48,000` = `4.8*10^4` = `4.8E4`

## Engineering notation.

Engineering notation is the same as scientific notation, but with exponents
only divisible by 3. This makes them align with prefixes and makes verbal
communication easier. Re-using the above example, 48,000 would be written as
`48*10^3` or `48E3`.

# SI base units

Most base units have a historical definition grounded in simpler measurements.
In modern times, they are put in relation to very specific physical constants
in order to increase precision and to account for modern scientific theories.

Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units).

## Time

Time has the common symbol `t`.

| Unit       | Symbol | Defined by                          |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **second** | s      | Historically, a division of the day |

## Length

Length has the common symbol `l`.

| Unit         | Symbol    | Defined by |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **meter**    | m         | Historically, 10,000 km was the distance from the equator to the north pole |
| inch         | in or "   | 2.54 cm    |
| foot         | foot or ' | 12 in      |
| yard         | yd        | 3 feet     |
| mile         | mi        | 1,760 yd   |
| Swedish mile |           | 10km       |

## Mass

Mass has the common symbol `m`. It is commonly referred to as weight, but
weight is rather force caused by gravity.

| Unit     | Symbol | Defined by                                            |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **gram** | g      | Historically, 1 kg is the mass of one liter of water. |
| pound    | lb     | circa 0.454 kg                                        |
| ounce    | oz     | 1/16 pound                                            |
| stone    | st     | 14 pounds                                             |

## Temperature

Temperature has the common symbol `T`.

| Unit       | Symbol | Defined by |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Kelvin** | K      | The same scale as celsius, but 0K, absolute zero, equals -273.15°C |
| Celsius    | °C     | Linear scale where 0°C is the freezing temperature of water and 100°C is the boiling temperature of water |
| Farenheit  | °F     | Exact origins vague, but temperature defined in relation to Celsius as `5/9(x − 32) °C` |
| Rankine    | °Ra    | As Kelvin is to Celsius, T<sub>°Ra</sub> = 5/9 × T<sub>K</sub>

## Current

Current uses the symbol `I`.

| Unit       | Symbol | Defined by                       |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| **Ampere** | A      | Historically, coloumb per second |

The SI definition of ampere was formerly charge over time, with ampere being
defined as coloumb per second. Later revisions has reversed the relation, and
an ampere is technically defined directly as 6.241509074×10<sup>18</sup>
electrons per second.

# Unnamed SI derived units

A few units relatively fundamental to the human experience don't have SI names
and are just referred to by their relation to the base units. However,
historical named units may exist.

## Velocity

meter per second
knop

## Acceleration

meter per second per second

## Area

square meter
hectare
american football fields

## Volume
